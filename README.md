Simple Flask application as a final challenge in the IGTI Python Developer Bootcamp. The goal was to determine among three machine learning algorithms the one with the best accuracy to predict whether a person has diabetes and show the result in a GUI.

### Tech:

  - Python
  - Flask
  - Scikit-learn
  - Google Colab (for the initial part where I chose among the three models)

### Data Files:
  - Machine Learning Model:  
  - Google Colab code: 

### Setup:
  - Install Flask
  ```  
python -m pip install flask
```
  - Run the project:
  ```
  python app.py
```
